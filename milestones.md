what client had asked for: 
What do I want
I want to complete my CryptoPolio web application, which is a university practice project for my essay and must be finished by January 30. The project is built with the MERN stack and is intended as a crypto portfolio management platform for tracking assets, allocations, profit/loss, and historical performance. This is a demo and presentation-focused project, not a production or enterprise-level system.
My main requirements are to complete missing core features and significantly improve the overall quality of the application. Specifically, I need asset management functionality (add, edit, remove assets with proper calculations) and a virtual buy/sell system for demo purposes. Price data integration and basic historical performance tracking should also work correctly.
In addition to functionality, UI/UX is critical. The current design is weak and outdated, and I want it redesigned into a modern, creative, and original interface with clear visual hierarchy and good usability. The design must not copy existing platforms like CoinMarketCap or CoinStats, but instead feel unique, professional, and presentation-ready for academic evaluation.
I expect structured work with clear milestones ( 3 steps ), a two-week timeline, and daily progress updates via Git and screenshots. The goal is to deliver a stable, visually strong project that demonstrates both technical implementation and thoughtful design, suitable for university submission and portfolio use.
